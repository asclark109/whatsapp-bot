[2024-11-19T21:32:44.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Hey everyone!! 

I’m hopping on here to remind you that we have our last Glory Night of the year THIS FRIDAY, 7:45 @ 152 Arlington St! 

Guys I’m especially expectant for all the Lord has in store for us. We’re going to be sharing testimonies and talking about the faithfulness of God, so you better be ready to share what He’s done for you!! 

Bring a friend + see you there :)

[2024-11-22T01:20:10.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Work isn’t going badly. In fact it’s going very well, and people at work are really excited about the thing I’ve been building, and that’s just generating lots of work. Especially since My mentor is getting promoted and I’ve been asked to assume her former role, but also that means I’m basically asked to continue to build in my domain and handle her former domain as well, which is just more work
[2024-11-22T01:20:34.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Hope the talk is interesting! I met the girl who is giving the talk. Just once

_prepare for some sappy message at some point later today or tomorrow if i remember_

*But the TLDR of that message to come;*

You guys are as much of my gift from God as my choir at the St. Francis chapel. 

They may be my bouquet of flowers from God, but you guys are my precious delicious box of assorted chocolate from Him - with all the different, dynamic and special flavors!!

I prayed for 3 conditions when God asked me to stay in Boston:
1. Friends

[2024-12-08T16:45:06.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: But see I figured doing archery would level the playing field because I would wipe all you guys in paintball. Wouldn’t be fair

[2024-12-08T18:40:56.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I hope I wasn’t included in that “everyone” bc u are certainly no competition for me 🙂 just let us know when and where 💪🏽

[2024-12-08T19:46:05.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: To be clear the men are wearing suits but not tuxedos for Hawthorne?
[2024-12-08T19:46:57.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Says black tie, but…I’m assuming they really mean formal and not actually black tie?
[2024-12-08T19:55:44.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: @16037166863
[2024-12-08T19:57:41.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: I feel like 95% of the time people use “black tie” inappropriately so i gotta ask to clarify. Black tie = tuxedos for men and night gowns for women. So I assume what they *really* mean is formal
[2024-12-08T19:59:22.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Anyone else here at the concert? Where y’all at?

[2024-12-09T23:02:36.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: I didn’t do show and tell of any drawings at Adriano’s, but talk of Audrey’s school made me think about something. When I was in undergrad I had an interest in education and did things like teach a class to high schoolers on The Weeknd. Also I took a course in producing educational videos, which I was terrible at because I didn’t know how to do film, editing, animations etc. so if you guys want to laugh at 19 year old Austin. Here you go. My class project
[2024-12-09T23:02:52.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: It’s so dramatic and cringe. And the editing is garbage, and the sound is garbage, and… but the effort was high so the professors appreciated it 😂

[2024-12-11T08:06:19.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Talking about this stuff made me think of the marriage problem. Extensively studied problem in computer science as you can imagine since nerds need love too. A classically optimal strategy that emerges is that is if N is the hypothetical number of suitors in your life (the number of people who you could potentially marry) you reject the first N/e suitors. Let M be the “value” of the best suitor in the first N/e suitors. Then, the next suitor who is at least value M you should marry. If you do, with probably 1/e you will marry the suitor of highest value. Put short, after going through the first 37% of suitors in your life, marry the next suitor better than the best of the first 37% of suitors  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem
[2024-12-11T08:09:46.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: In actuality the problem recurs over and over, so it makes sense to study it. You have an unknown stream of objects of varying value. You must choose one object but do not know the value distribution of those objects as they come. Once you reject an object you cannot return later to it for reconsideration, so how can you max your odds of selecting the best thing you see
[2024-12-11T11:25:18.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Y’all are such nerds, I love it!

[2024-12-15T20:35:13.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Here

[2024-12-15T20:35:31.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: 
[2024-12-15T20:35:43.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: We are on the far right side!
[2024-12-15T20:35:47.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Towards the front
[2024-12-15T23:19:16.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: It is a funny coincidence that Kevin was talking about his spiritual experiences last night. Because while on the road it began snowing, and I decided to say a prayer for safe driving. Sure enough 10 minutes later I lost control on the highway and veered off road. Cars completely fine and I’m completely fine. I was going 70 mph maybe.
[2024-12-15T23:20:18.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Oh my gosh!! Glad you are safe🙏🏼
[2024-12-15T23:20:23.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Yeah!
[2024-12-15T23:25:40.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Awww Austin so glad you’re safe!!
[2024-12-16T00:52:48.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: What a testimony, Austin! That was truly the prompting of the Holy Spirit that moved you to say that little prayer! I’m glad you made it home safe and sound!
[2024-12-16T01:10:23.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Hah. I believe my hunch to say a prayer was purely intuition, but I definitely think it was a prayer answered. Central PA has been a wreck past hour since it came on hard snow and roads were not salted in time.
[2024-12-16T01:10:56.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Well, I don’t know what I don’t know.
[2024-12-16T01:12:29.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Not home yet I’m staying the night in PA because I slid off the highway twice in total. So I was like F that im getting a hotel
[2024-12-16T01:13:16.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Also, I had 4 wheel drive on. Which is crazy to think about
[2024-12-16T01:16:50.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Wow, that sounds really scary! I am sending my guardian angel to you as you travel (since they can trilocate because they are cool like that)!
[2024-12-16T01:23:01.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: I’ve never had such an appreciation for salt until now
[2024-12-16T02:22:55.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Good idea

[2024-12-28T17:36:20.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Exactly and I think learning from history can help us prepare for/prevent corps having standing armies

[2025-01-15T04:00:37.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Hello, Gods Golden Nuggets,

As you all know, this weekend is the Epiphany ball (woohoo🎉). So, from what I understand, we will have a pre-epiphany ball get together at my place (255 Hancock Street, North Quincy, MA 02171) starting at 4p. It only takes about 20min to get to the venue from my place so, we can leave “early”(6:30p) or get there fashionably late.

For those doing the book club, I believe we’re meeting earlier?? Idk what time or if that’ll still happen on Saturday?? Kev and Paul can confirm (pls&thnx)

Lastly, if we would like to have a post-epiphany ball wind-down session, I propose we leave 10p from the event, head back to my place and spend like 1.5-2hrs recapping the night until 12a(and that is a HARD STOP because Celine and I have 5 Masses that Sunday and we ain’t got the time to be tired)

Alright, thanks for coming to my TedTalk.

Thanks,
Mgmt 

P.s. if anyone would like to join for any of the morning Masses, you are more than welcome to 🫶🏽

[2025-01-20T00:38:13.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: There’s a watch party @ the Catholic center - this is what was sent in the group chat: 

The college football championship is tomorrow at 7:30pm — Ohio State vs Notre Dame, which makes it Catholic relevant, haha.
We’re hosting a watch party in the HCC student lounge, with doors opening at 7pm. All are welcome to drop in, even OSU fans. Feel free to bring food or drinks. We can order some pizza once the game starts
[2025-01-20T00:56:05.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: My apartment got slightly more hospitable
[2025-01-20T00:56:12.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: The first non-hard seat

[2025-01-20T02:01:48.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Aaaahhh the women gotta keep quiet though. That’s you @14159400947

[2025-01-21T20:23:35.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: @16037166863 about to drop some facts and logic on us
[2025-01-21T20:23:41.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: @16037166863 In New Hampshire!!
[2025-01-21T20:24:07.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: An intellectual
[2025-01-21T20:25:44.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Oh that looks fun
[2025-01-21T20:27:04.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Group discount?
[2025-01-21T20:27:41.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Maybe? I actually dont know. My friend said that he wasnt going to go skiing but he will be snow tubing and hot chocolate-ing
[2025-01-21T20:31:40.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Oooooooooooo I like tubing
[2025-01-21T20:31:46.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’d be down to go
[2025-01-21T20:34:24.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Im trying to remember my solo day at Pat’s, it’s a small mountain but well run and the tubing looked fun
[2025-01-21T20:34:45.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: It was on the independent ski pass so I had tickets 🥹
[2025-01-21T20:34:45.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Comeeeee
[2025-01-21T20:40:35.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Speaking of skiiiiiiii
[2025-01-21T20:41:06.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Y’all, so, with lent coming up in a little over a month, we really only have the month of February for any real big shindigs
[2025-01-21T20:42:57.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: So, what if we plan to come up to @16037166863 in February during the weekend of the 21st. We’d head on on Friday night, and then those who need to leave Saturday for Mass on Sunday can leave Saturday evening/night (I.e. Celine and I, and whoever else who wants a ride back)
[2025-01-21T20:43:43.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: And then the following weekend which is actually March 1st, I’m thinking about having a Saturday brunch at my place again
[2025-01-21T20:57:24.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: That sounds great!!
[2025-01-21T21:03:02.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: finally a party at paul's 🥳
[2025-01-21T21:07:35.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: It will be huge fun
[2025-01-21T21:08:14.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’m exciiittedddd🤭🤭🤭
[2025-01-21T21:13:03.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Everyone, mark your calendars! Road trip to Paul’s for GG’s nuggets first annual family ski  trip⛷️🎿 from February 21st-22nd/23rd!! @14159400947 @17037851134 @16037166863@17744201479 @13147437071 @19077177876@4915150998040 @19784712132 @16264612355 @19042103886 @15406227058 @15636632176 @12245189795 @18607366453
[2025-01-21T21:14:49.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: How much would all this cost 👀
[2025-01-21T21:18:24.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: 
[2025-01-21T21:23:33.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: V good question @16037166863 could you send that one link you sent about skiing? I almost wanna say it was free 🥹
[2025-01-21T21:24:12.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: https://skistorrshill.com/free-community-skiing
[2025-01-21T21:24:41.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: We would still need rentals which could cost anywhere from $50-100 imo
[2025-01-21T21:25:10.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: But for comparison, skiing at pat’s peak, for buying a ticket in advance, is $99
[2025-01-21T21:25:21.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: So the free skiing helps a ton 😅
[2025-01-21T21:59:47.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Paul you gotta drive by and scope it out 🤣
[2025-01-21T22:00:43.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: But ps they don’t do rentals so you’d have to find a ski shop. Apparently there’s a couple in Lebanon
[2025-01-21T22:04:34.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Okay, gratci @16037166863! Some of us are still in school and/or balling on a budget so, Storrs Hill looks to be our best option atm. But we would still need to rent gear? From the Storrs hill place, @17744201479 ?
[2025-01-21T22:04:35.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Lebanon...the country??
[2025-01-21T22:07:45.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: The wonderful city in New Hampshire 😂 Yes, you would need to rent gear. But that mountain is small and they don’t rent according to their website. So you’d have to find a local shop in town. In my experience in Vermont rentals can range from $40-80 a day when there’s lots of competition in the area
[2025-01-21T22:08:49.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Okay cool— good to know!! Thanks Adriano!
[2025-01-21T22:09:27.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: With this being said I don’t recall Lebanon being a ski town so might be more pricey. Let’s look for a store and confirm a price before going, I’d say.
[2025-01-21T22:10:01.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Paul is right, if you rent + day pass it’s insanely expensive. All the discounts nowadays are handed to people who go frequently and have season passes. The cost is passed down to the casual skier sadly.
[2025-01-21T22:10:43.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Killington day tickets are up 50% adjusted for inflation over the last decade for example, it’s discouraging
[2025-01-21T22:12:21.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Hmm, okay that’s understandable..what do you propose then? Maybe a different activity altogether in New Hampshire? I’m down for paintballing 👀
[2025-01-21T22:12:54.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I propose finding a ski shop that can get you guys hooked up with gear that’s all 😃
[2025-01-21T22:27:20.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I have asked some friends of mine who ski all the time if Storrs is a good mountain
[2025-01-21T22:27:23.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: So tbd on that
[2025-01-21T22:27:48.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Rentals could be done anywhere, theoretically, so long as we bring them back in time
[2025-01-21T22:29:09.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I mean pat’s peak with rentals on site would be $160, which is quite pricey, but also guaranteed quality and convenience
[2025-01-21T22:31:17.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: https://icecastles.com/new-hampshire/
[2025-01-21T22:32:31.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Really would highly recommend—ice castles are beautiful 🥹
[2025-01-21T23:14:40.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’m down for this one!
[2025-01-21T23:16:49.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Tickets are cheap too
[2025-01-22T00:25:54.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Okay, so while you guys are sorting out Skiing...im thinking about going country line dancing either Tuesday 01/28, 02/04 or 02/11 at Loretta's in Fenway. It's every Tue. and Sun.
[2025-01-22T00:27:02.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I could do Sunday but it has to be this upcoming Sunday because I (and Stacey) have rehearsals on Sundays after this month
[2025-01-22T00:27:39.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Anywayy, let me know if you want to join. No worries if you don't. I'll b going regardless! 🥳👢🐄🤠
[2025-01-22T00:44:48.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I am not opposed!
[2025-01-22T00:47:30.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I think I’m down! I gotta see how my studying goes this week but, count me in for now!
[2025-01-22T01:03:07.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’m also down for the ice castle! I would love to go line dancing, but I can’t do next week because I am cooking house dinner on Sunday, and it is Catholic Schools Week during the week, so I will need all of my energy to take on the week
[2025-01-22T01:03:42.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Also, anyone thinking about the St. Mary’s New Year’s Eve party or St. Paul’s 150th Anniversary on Saturday of this weekend?
[2025-01-22T01:03:52.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: 
[2025-01-22T01:04:49.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: 
[2025-01-22T01:07:12.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Oo I’ll definitely go to this one
[2025-01-22T01:07:26.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Maybe to the St Mary’s one
[2025-01-22T01:08:02.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: 100% in, any excuse to dress like a cowboy
[2025-01-22T01:09:06.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I didn’t hear about this Emily! Sounds like fun but I can’t make it this weekend 😩
[2025-01-22T01:19:06.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I miiiighhtt be available for this! I remember Fr.George mentioning this back in December!
[2025-01-23T17:41:08.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: If we go during off-peak, id b down
[2025-01-23T17:41:36.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Are you thinking about going to both? 👀
[2025-01-23T17:43:47.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’m so in!
[2025-01-23T17:44:25.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Trying to get caught up on the skiing deets but did we decide on killington? I have pass discounts if people are interested
[2025-01-23T17:48:05.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Please do share the details on pass discounts 👀 asking for the friends
[2025-01-23T17:51:14.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Yeah killington was not on the table iirc but it’s supposed to be the best skiing—if you have a good discount we definitely should go there
[2025-01-23T17:53:00.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I have 25% off for people or if we want to lock in now I think I can get 35% off
[2025-01-23T17:53:36.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: At killington or any ikon pass resort
[2025-01-23T17:58:22.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Also i think j could hook people up with cheap rentals $30 ish
[2025-01-23T18:00:00.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: As someone who’s been skiing for 24 years it’s so sad and absurd how expensive it’s gotten
[2025-01-23T18:03:10.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Well dang. Does Feb. 21-23 work for everyone?? _Please raise your hand_
[2025-01-23T18:20:13.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Do you have a limit on discounted tickets with Ikon @19077177876 ? That’s fine for me those dates, my yearly killington ski trip starts the 23 so I’ll be there anyways 😃
[2025-01-23T19:08:28.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Also @19077177876 when would you need to know to get 35% to lock in?
[2025-01-24T02:12:33.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I have 8 discounts left and would need to get the tickets before 14 Feb
[2025-01-24T02:14:05.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: With the discount it’s still $108 a day
[2025-01-24T02:20:37.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Are there no more than eight people interested?
[2025-01-24T02:20:50.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Just to skii? Or to skii and stay? Or just to stay?
[2025-01-24T02:21:21.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Also to be clear if we went 2/21-23, we would only ski Saturday realistically, right?
[2025-01-24T02:21:47.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I would suggest we probably would want to find a place to stay
[2025-01-24T02:22:04.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: So it would be $108, plus rental, plus lodging imo
[2025-01-24T02:22:08.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Do 10 people just to be safe. Also, for anyone worried about church sunday. Stacey and I will be heading back to Bos from NH either early Sunday or late Saturday so dont worry if that is a concern ( _ahem_ @19042103886 @15636632176 _ahem_)
[2025-01-24T02:22:37.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Well if Taylor has only eight discounts though—idk if we have that many people even interested
[2025-01-24T02:22:55.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I wont skii. I just want to be there!! So someone can take my spot worse comes to worse
[2025-01-24T02:22:56.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I know 8 people liked the message!
[2025-01-24T02:23:31.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Oh wait, im not in the 8 LOL
[2025-01-24T02:23:35.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: If push comes to shove—I have a job, I can pay full price if need be 🤑
[2025-01-24T02:24:34.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: 2/14 is an easy deadline for buying tickets with the discount, but for lodging we probably would want to move asap
[2025-01-24T02:25:04.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I don’t really know how to ski. Are there kid slopes or things for beginners I can use? Or do I need to take some lessons first?
[2025-01-24T02:25:25.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Also do they have tubing 👀
[2025-01-24T02:25:42.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Me and you both. We can make hot chocolate and play in the snow 🤪🤣
[2025-01-24T02:28:38.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Yeah just daily lift tickets are included in the discount
[2025-01-24T02:29:07.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: So we could have 4x skiers for 2 days or 8x skiers for 1 day
[2025-01-24T02:45:27.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I can join for skiing or frolicking, I am happy just to be around!
[2025-01-24T02:47:12.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: It has been awhile since I’ve been skiing anyways, so can’t say that I would have a ton of guts to get back on the slopes, so if there is a spare ticket, I’ll take it, but if not, consider me there for the vibes 😎
[2025-01-24T12:33:40.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: I parsed the chat as best I could. I’m happy to join the trip especially if it helps dilute the cost of lodging, but I don’t mind skiing or not skiing, so I can be with Celine. $50-100 for renting skis is approximately how much it’s worth it to me to ski.
[2025-01-24T12:39:08.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Yes, it works but I can sit out of the rental discount
[2025-01-24T13:03:30.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Choose your adventure
[2025-01-24T13:06:00.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: ^ everyone complete the poll please so we can get a clear count of who wants to ski vs chill :)

[2025-01-24T14:14:56.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I think it is good any time 😇
[2025-01-24T14:15:22.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: It’s a great day trip i.e. we go up like Saturday morning and return in evening
[2025-01-24T16:38:17.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Assuming @14159400947 wants to ski too

[2025-01-24T18:56:48.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: There’s enough beds for everyone tho if the boys don’t mind cuddling in a queen
[2025-01-24T18:59:28.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Also I’m officially in the baby slope ski group 🤝 (aka Ariele, Stacey, and I)

[2025-01-24T19:16:13.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: And besides how would you all get the discount?
[2025-01-24T19:16:24.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: BAHAHAHAHA ur the main guy!!!

[2025-01-24T19:17:07.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: AS IN IF THE 8 INCLUDED YOU 😂😂🤣🤣😭😭😭
[2025-01-24T19:17:34.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Oh nah I have a pass so it’s theoretically free technically like 80 bucks for me
[2025-01-24T19:17:47.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’m way too bought into the ski industry
[2025-01-24T19:18:14.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: If there’s not enough beds I can crash on a couch or something
[2025-01-24T19:18:55.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: bois?? 👀
[2025-01-24T19:19:18.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: There’s def enough beds
[2025-01-24T20:53:32.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: So we should probably reserve soon
[2025-01-24T22:56:05.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Soooo couple questions:
1) are we committed to two nights? To save money we could all drive up Saturday morning, ski stay the night into Sunday and drive back Sunday night. Or shift that plan left a day if people want to make church on Sunday (I won’t make Friday)
2) do we want to spend the night an hour away from the resort when killington is 2.5 hrs from Boston? 
3) if we go for the 2-day/one night option we can get a place closer to killington and save $$$
[2025-01-24T23:00:10.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I found this place for 1369 for one night that’s 20-30 mins from killington
[2025-01-24T23:02:12.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: There’s also a similarly priced place in Rutland a 20 min drive away
[2025-01-24T23:03:29.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I am in support of just one night + I know Elizabeth said she'd prefer one night oo
[2025-01-24T23:03:58.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: too*
[2025-01-24T23:05:49.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Also one night pls 🙋🏽‍♀️ Celine and I would be leaving either Saturday night or early Sunday to make it for the morning Masses
[2025-01-24T23:08:47.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Friday night into sat then?
[2025-01-24T23:19:19.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’m down
[2025-01-25T00:01:09.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Is anyone going to play without ceasing 👀
[2025-01-25T00:13:22.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I am not 😭 sry :(
[2025-01-25T17:40:56.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: If we do one night are we still doing Arielle’s place?
[2025-01-25T17:41:30.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Let me check the price if we do one night!
[2025-01-25T17:54:56.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Gosh, I made it through the group chat😮‍💨 We need summaries every now and then, so people can skip the rest… I am interested in skiing and prefer two days/ one night. Don’t care if Friday to Saturday or Saturday to Sunday but definitely need a Sunday mass (Catholic obligation and stuff besides I actually want to go). Wow, feels great to finally participate in this group chat😂
[2025-01-25T18:11:57.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: We can also go to mass together up in the mountains, we don’t have to be back in Boston for that. Just throwing that out there
[2025-01-25T18:12:20.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Mountain mass sounds sick

[2025-01-25T18:33:22.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: And a side tangent: anyone else a fan of Knox? He has a new album coming out that I am hyped for, and he will be performing in Boston the night of Palm Sunday (April 13th) if anyone is down to go! 🎸🎤
[2025-01-25T18:35:45.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: But yeah, I think I might be team head back to Boston for Mass with Celine and Stacey, but the temptation to explore new churches is always there 🤩
[2025-01-25T19:43:13.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Emily girl! I decided to come tonight to St.Pauls so, I’ll see you there🫶🏽!
[2025-01-25T19:43:47.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’m thinking too… what about the rest?
[2025-01-25T20:11:08.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’m also going to the St. Paul’s thing! :)
[2025-01-25T20:11:18.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Just dance lowkey sounds fun 👀
[2025-01-25T20:12:24.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’ll see how I feel after the St. Paul’s thing though
[2025-01-25T20:12:46.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Elizabeth & I are still in DC so won’t make it 💔
[2025-01-25T20:12:54.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Is the thing at St Paul’s a wine and cheese thing?
[2025-01-25T20:15:48.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: It is exactly that
[2025-01-25T20:16:00.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Yep!

[2025-01-25T20:38:37.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I think that Father George said that it is open to all young adults, grad students, and young professionals when I saw him last
[2025-01-25T22:34:27.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Re: skiing we should lock in a place this weekend cause there aren’t many options left
[2025-01-25T22:38:28.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I think we have to agree because someone will front the money that we will pay, even if something comes up and plans change etc
[2025-01-25T22:42:35.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I prefer 3 days, 2 nights so that we hav more time together, even if Stacey, Emily and I cant stay for the entirety of Sunday and have mass in the mountains
[2025-01-25T22:42:58.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: However, I'm cool with whatever the majority is most comfortable with so let me make a poll and let's settle it asap
[2025-01-25T22:43:50.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Duration of Trip
[2025-01-25T22:43:54.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: As much as I’d love to do 2 nights I’m probably just going to do 1 night 2 days but happy to throw in a pro-rate for the 2nd day to balance things out
[2025-01-25T22:44:11.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: If WhatsApp has an api we can definitely make a bot that will take the feed of texts, feed into ChatGPT, then posts a message in the WhatsApp that summarizes the state of affairs
[2025-01-25T22:44:24.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Similar to what discord or Reddit and other platforms have these days
[2025-01-25T22:44:45.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: 
[2025-01-25T22:44:50.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Let’s get it done Austin
[2025-01-25T22:45:19.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Better yet ask ChatGPT to just write all code. lol
[2025-01-26T00:11:55.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Ur our guy, Austin
[2025-01-26T00:12:49.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: But ai is going to know everything that we saidddd

[2025-01-26T03:47:38.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Haha you guys should go to “passion city church”. It’s like the popping young people church where it’s like a music concert, pastor is awesome, and it’s pretty flirty. You also won’t see a person over 40 basically 🧏🏼‍♀️. So Elizabeth will enjoy
[2025-01-26T03:48:38.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: It’s where my good friends from back home go
[2025-01-26T03:48:44.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Non denominational
[2025-01-26T05:08:12.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us:

[2025-01-26T05:09:28.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Celine and I were just talking about you
[2025-01-26T05:09:38.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Good things I hope Shiela
[2025-01-26T05:10:18.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Hahaha I was sharing with her a dream I had. And you saved me through dance
[2025-01-26T05:10:24.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: It was hilarious hahaha
[2025-01-26T05:10:58.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: And then we were both like “man we love Adriano. He’s such a good friend”
[2025-01-26T05:15:01.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Celine is trying to lobby me to get me to change my vote 😡
[2025-01-26T05:15:24.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Yea I’m on the phone with her now. I support 🫡
[2025-01-26T05:15:58.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: No im not. Im just inquiring for your thoughts 😤

[2025-01-26T05:16:28.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’m whistle blowing
[2025-01-26T14:38:46.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: @19784712132 you locking in the Airbnb?

[2025-01-26T14:40:18.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Also the price went down!
[2025-01-26T14:40:39.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: It will now be 100 per person for two nights
[2025-01-26T14:41:58.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Oh yay!! What’s the total price?
[2025-01-26T14:43:33.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: With taxes and fees it’s 1400$ total
[2025-01-26T14:43:42.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: For Feb 21-23
[2025-01-26T14:45:12.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: If we do one night it’s 60$ a person
[2025-01-26T14:48:41.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Oh man you should have opened a new credit card and gotten the sign up bonus that’s some money rt there
[2025-01-26T14:49:04.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Count me in
[2025-01-26T14:49:43.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Chase sapphire preferred CC. You get $600 if you spend $4k first 3 months
[2025-01-26T14:49:51.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Bahahahaha
[2025-01-26T14:50:02.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: I went down the rabbit hole recently
[2025-01-26T14:50:03.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: should I book one night?
[2025-01-26T14:50:49.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: I’m thinking of some final way to lock in everyone’s decision before you pull trigger
[2025-01-26T14:52:04.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: The question is if someone from the two nighter wants to now pullout given it’s only one night but that’s not me
[2025-01-26T14:52:22.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Vice a versa…😒
[2025-01-26T14:52:58.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Whatever is decided I’ll stand behind (paying for my portion and being in)
[2025-01-26T14:53:33.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: If 8 people want to do two nights they pay the 2 night prices and 1 nighters pay the one night
[2025-01-26T14:54:15.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I say we send it we have everyone’s preferences
[2025-01-26T14:54:24.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Re:
[2025-01-26T14:57:50.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Good idea!!
[2025-01-26T14:58:16.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Hmmm if we do the one night what time would we be getting back on Saturday?
[2025-01-26T14:58:32.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Like people won’t be too tired to drive after skiing right?
[2025-01-26T14:59:28.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I think if you can stay the two nights, def stay the two nights. If you’re seriously tight on cash or have a commitment like Celine and Stacey then stay one night!
[2025-01-26T15:00:05.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Anyone have a Costco membership?
[2025-01-26T15:00:13.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Celine and Stacey want two night
[2025-01-26T15:00:21.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: But will leave Sunday morning
[2025-01-26T15:00:22.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: YAY
[2025-01-26T15:00:45.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: okay I’m gonna book the two nights, if you’re really strapped for cash or can’t stay both nights let me know and I’m gonna do a slight price adjustment!!
[2025-01-26T15:02:15.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: 
[2025-01-26T15:11:02.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Stacey and Celine and Emily are commiting to 2 nights
[2025-01-26T15:11:15.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: If everyone could Venmo me 113$ I will book the chalet today! 

@13147437071 @12245189795 @4915150998040 @15406227058you guys can send me 70$
[2025-01-26T15:11:33.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: https://venmo.com/u/Ariele-Lee
[2025-01-26T15:12:05.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Yes ok that’s a decent compromise. So long as there’s no exodus of people who decide to stay 1 night it will keep down the cost per night for everyone
[2025-01-26T15:13:03.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: (Goes without saying the more people who flip to one night, the more it drives up the cost per night per person)
[2025-01-26T15:14:03.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: When do we need to commit to skiing @19077177876 👀
[2025-01-26T15:14:07.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Sent

[2025-01-26T15:18:49.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: I think it’s 5 people

[2025-01-26T15:25:52.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: aren't only 8 people able to ski with the discount?
[2025-01-26T15:27:21.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: In igbo, my mom says “ebe i si weputa, Chineke kwuachi’ng mmaji kwuru mmaji” which basically translates to “where you’ve taken out, may God repay you ten times over” ..the “mmaji kwuru mmaji” doesn’t actually mean “ten times over” but that’s basically what it’s trying to say

All that to say, thank you Taylor🥹 and God bless you🙏🏽♥️
[2025-01-26T15:27:45.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: nibe418@gmail.com
[2025-01-26T15:39:54.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: lol not to keep asking a bunch of questions but also what is the estimated cost for skiing for both the day pass and rentals again?
[2025-01-26T15:53:32.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Thank you for offering @19077177876. Can offer you for my Costco membership in return 😃 my email is adrianojsoares1@gmail.com
[2025-01-26T15:54:06.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Taylor can tell you the cost of the buddy pass, but rentals are probably about $40at the ski shops in town.
[2025-01-26T15:54:12.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: We should do a Costco run for food
[2025-01-26T15:54:14.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: And snacks
[2025-01-26T15:55:11.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Yeah standby
[2025-01-26T15:55:26.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: And seriously it’s nbd guys!! Just love skiing with people
[2025-01-26T16:00:01.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Lmk what the price is when you get the code (sending now) but Saturday the 22d with the 35% off is $116
[2025-01-26T16:05:58.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Adriano had a great idea: for us who aren’t quite the shredders who want to tear up the full killington mountain there’s a sister resort down the road called Pico for $99/day
[2025-01-26T16:06:27.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: It wouldn’t be that hard to spilt the group and then meet up for apres at the end of the day at killington
[2025-01-26T16:06:36.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: For ref:
[2025-01-26T16:07:25.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Yes, it’s a sister resort that belongs to Killington. There’s a 3 mile trail that connects them (lol) but also a bus IIRC. So it would be easy to meet up later.
[2025-01-26T16:16:00.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’ll do this
[2025-01-26T16:16:14.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Paid btw @19784712132

[2025-01-26T17:08:20.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I think they are are only supposed to be paying around fifty for the one night
[2025-01-26T17:08:34.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: It’s 70!

[2025-01-26T17:16:09.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Are we buying individually or venmoing someone?
[2025-01-26T17:17:17.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Taylor has to send you the code. Then you have to buy yourself.

[2025-01-26T17:39:10.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Math people can you confirm this breakdown
[2025-01-26T17:39:33.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Yeah Sheila might have a more accurate breakdown of the prices owed cuz I’m terrible at math

[2025-01-27T02:40:21.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: @19042103886 this is how I mathed it https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DRZdbfMKGfr64Ewp8Hgspz_MrTFb2SU-aYVK57Jh27I/edit?gid=0#gid=0
[2025-01-27T02:41:09.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: shared
[2025-01-27T02:41:32.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: 113$ sounds about right
[2025-01-27T02:46:27.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Now I’m confused haha okay so peeps for one night pay (53.85) and peeps who want to stay for two nights pay ($107)?
[2025-01-27T02:47:18.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Ooooo i didn’t have Audrey in the total
[2025-01-27T02:47:38.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Audrey isn’t able to come :(
[2025-01-27T02:48:26.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: How many people total are going
[2025-01-27T02:48:30.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I calculated 13
[2025-01-27T02:48:57.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: But I think it’s 14
[2025-01-27T02:52:09.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Also Ian mentioned he can stay two nights!
[2025-01-27T02:52:10.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: im looking at the votes
[2025-01-27T02:53:54.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: looking at the votes..and updating the spreadsheet give me a min
[2025-01-27T02:57:17.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: I haven't read the chat but if $1400 is the cost of the housing then the current state of the spreadsheet reflects the cost per person for housing alone. I am not including any kind of tangential activity costs
[2025-01-27T02:57:31.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Gas, food
[2025-01-27T02:57:34.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: looks like $122 for two nighters and 60.87 for 1 nighters
[2025-01-27T02:58:09.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: If Ian is two nights though don’t all our costs go down?
[2025-01-27T02:58:17.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: (For 2 nighters)
[2025-01-27T02:58:25.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: gas / food should probably be computed  separately to reduce confusion
[2025-01-27T02:58:30.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I wish we could have a PowerPoint night on this
[2025-01-27T02:58:33.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’m down for 2 nights if it helps
[2025-01-27T02:58:36.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: yes, I am including IAn at 2 nights
[2025-01-27T02:58:42.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Hooyah

[2024-11-19T20:54:54.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: An era when the chapel had BIBLE STUDY GROUPS IN 3 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES?!
[2024-11-19T21:32:44.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Hey everyone!! 

I’m hopping on here to remind you that we have our last Glory Night of the year THIS FRIDAY, 7:45 @ 152 Arlington St! 

Guys I’m especially expectant for all the Lord has in store for us. We’re going to be sharing testimonies and talking about the faithfulness of God, so you better be ready to share what He’s done for you!! 

Bring a friend + see you there :)
[2024-11-19T21:33:07.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: from my small group leader

[2024-11-19T23:57:09.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: He was trying to call me to help get me into the building cause the security guard couldnt find me in the guest list. But instead of actually calling me, he called the entire group chat 😂

[2024-11-19T23:59:38.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: the chapel used to hav priests who spoke different languages like italian, portugese, french, spanish and english so they used to hav daily mass in these different languages. The italian priest was named Fr. Antonini (i dont know how to spell it)

[2024-11-22T01:20:10.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Work isn’t going badly. In fact it’s going very well, and people at work are really excited about the thing I’ve been building, and that’s just generating lots of work. Especially since My mentor is getting promoted and I’ve been asked to assume her former role, but also that means I’m basically asked to continue to build in my domain and handle her former domain as well, which is just more work
[2024-11-22T01:20:34.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Hope the talk is interesting! I met the girl who is giving the talk. Just once

[2024-11-28T18:32:51.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: HAPPY THANKSGIVING FROM STACEY AND I @ SHALOM !!!

_prepare for some sappy message at some point later today or tomorrow if i remember_

*But the TLDR of that message to come;*

You guys are as much of my gift from God as my choir at the St. Francis chapel. 

They may be my bouquet of flowers from God, but you guys are my precious delicious box of assorted chocolate from Him - with all the different, dynamic and special flavors!!

I prayed for 3 conditions when God asked me to stay in Boston:
1. Friends
2. A job
3. Some fire in my heart
And I can 💯 say that He fulfilled that first part of my prayer by gifting me with you all in this group 🥹🙏 thank you for loving me cause I mean it when I say _I love you guys_.

HAPPY THANKSGIVING TURKEYYYYYY NERDZ!!! 🤪🥳🦃🍗🥕🥦🧅🧄💃🕺🪇

[2024-12-08T19:46:57.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Says black tie, but…I’m assuming they really mean formal and not actually black tie?

[2024-12-08T19:57:41.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: I feel like 95% of the time people use “black tie” inappropriately so i gotta ask to clarify. Black tie = tuxedos for men and night gowns for women. So I assume what they *really* mean is formal
[2024-12-08T19:59:22.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Anyone else here at the concert? Where y’all at?

[2024-12-09T23:02:36.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: I didn’t do show and tell of any drawings at Adriano’s, but talk of Audrey’s school made me think about something. When I was in undergrad I had an interest in education and did things like teach a class to high schoolers on The Weeknd. Also I took a course in producing educational videos, which I was terrible at because I didn’t know how to do film, editing, animations etc. so if you guys want to laugh at 19 year old Austin. Here you go. My class project
[2024-12-09T23:02:52.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: It’s so dramatic and cringe. And the editing is garbage, and the sound is garbage, and… but the effort was high so the professors appreciated it 😂

[2024-12-09T23:15:56.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: One of things I hated about that class is that every other student in that class was that kid who’s been making YouTube videos since they were 10 and make beautiful animations, edits, etc

[2024-12-11T08:06:19.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Talking about this stuff made me think of the marriage problem. Extensively studied problem in computer science as you can imagine since nerds need love too. A classically optimal strategy that emerges is that is if N is the hypothetical number of suitors in your life (the number of people who you could potentially marry) you reject the first N/e suitors. Let M be the “value” of the best suitor in the first N/e suitors. Then, the next suitor who is at least value M you should marry. If you do, with probably 1/e you will marry the suitor of highest value. Put short, after going through the first 37% of suitors in your life, marry the next suitor better than the best of the first 37% of suitors  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem
[2024-12-11T08:09:46.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: In actuality the problem recurs over and over, so it makes sense to study it. You have an unknown stream of objects of varying value. You must choose one object but do not know the value distribution of those objects as they come. Once you reject an object you cannot return later to it for reconsideration, so how can you max your odds of selecting the best thing you see
[2024-12-11T11:25:18.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Y’all are such nerds, I love it!

[2024-12-15T20:34:55.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: At St Paul’s!!
[2024-12-15T20:35:13.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Here
[2024-12-15T20:35:19.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’ll find y’all
[2024-12-15T20:35:31.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: 
[2024-12-15T20:35:43.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: We are on the far right side!
[2024-12-15T20:35:47.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Towards the front
[2024-12-15T23:19:16.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: It is a funny coincidence that Kevin was talking about his spiritual experiences last night. Because while on the road it began snowing, and I decided to say a prayer for safe driving. Sure enough 10 minutes later I lost control on the highway and veered off road. Cars completely fine and I’m completely fine. I was going 70 mph maybe.
[2024-12-15T23:20:18.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Oh my gosh!! Glad you are safe🙏🏼
[2024-12-15T23:20:23.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Yeah!
[2024-12-15T23:25:40.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Awww Austin so glad you’re safe!!
[2024-12-16T00:52:48.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: What a testimony, Austin! That was truly the prompting of the Holy Spirit that moved you to say that little prayer! I’m glad you made it home safe and sound!
[2024-12-16T01:10:23.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Hah. I believe my hunch to say a prayer was purely intuition, but I definitely think it was a prayer answered. Central PA has been a wreck past hour since it came on hard snow and roads were not salted in time.
[2024-12-16T01:10:56.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Well, I don’t know what I don’t know.
[2024-12-16T01:12:29.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Not home yet I’m staying the night in PA because I slid off the highway twice in total. So I was like F that im getting a hotel
[2024-12-16T01:13:16.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Also, I had 4 wheel drive on. Which is crazy to think about
[2024-12-16T01:16:50.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Wow, that sounds really scary! I am sending my guardian angel to you as you travel (since they can trilocate because they are cool like that)!
[2024-12-16T01:23:01.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: I’ve never had such an appreciation for salt until now
[2024-12-16T02:22:55.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Good idea
[2024-12-17T01:47:03.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: THE ROSTER

Tuesday when I was working he asked me to go to target with him. And when k said I couldn’t go he began to explain “but they have *trucks* at target”. As if that would convince me lol. And when explaining things he bobs his hand up and down while talking like he’s Mussolini or something 😂

[2024-12-28T14:53:47.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: 
[2024-12-28T14:53:47.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Christmas brunch sponsored by the Lord. It was All-You-Can-Eat 😂 This was some of their first Christmas away from home or first christmas playing for mass, so it was very special for them that we all got to share that together and not alone 🥹 overall, it was an _amazing_ 6 masses that we played for 🙌 All for God's glory!! 🥳🪇✨

[2024-12-28T17:29:05.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: But may I ask
[2024-12-28T17:29:08.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Of all human history
[2024-12-28T17:29:16.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: How did we land on the British east india company

[2024-12-28T17:30:08.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I mean it is a consequential actor in a significant region of the world
[2024-12-28T17:30:24.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’m in my “wants to be a part of an international scheme” phase alright
[2024-12-28T17:30:28.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Just not one I’ve thought of lately
[2024-12-28T17:30:42.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Yes international scheme

[2024-12-28T17:32:31.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: This is exactly it… I wanted to read it cause we’ve grown up in a world where nation-state governments are the major security actors but that’s changing. With a move to a multi-polar world I think multinational corporations will have more room to maneuver and the last time we saw that kind of space in the world was in the 17-18th centuries
[2024-12-28T17:33:05.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Like the EIC had double the army size of the British crown military at the time of the American revolution

[2024-12-28T17:35:24.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Did the drones look like this?
[2024-12-28T17:36:20.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Exactly and I think learning from history can help us prepare for/prevent corps having standing armies
[2024-12-28T17:37:03.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: They looked like a morph of Jeff bezos face and the East India company

[2025-01-15T04:00:37.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Hello, Gods Golden Nuggets,

As you all know, this weekend is the Epiphany ball (woohoo🎉). So, from what I understand, we will have a pre-epiphany ball get together at my place (255 Hancock Street, North Quincy, MA 02171) starting at 4p. It only takes about 20min to get to the venue from my place so, we can leave “early”(6:30p) or get there fashionably late.

For those doing the book club, I believe we’re meeting earlier?? Idk what time or if that’ll still happen on Saturday?? Kev and Paul can confirm (pls&thnx)

Lastly, if we would like to have a post-epiphany ball wind-down session, I propose we leave 10p from the event, head back to my place and spend like 1.5-2hrs recapping the night until 12a(and that is a HARD STOP because Celine and I have 5 Masses that Sunday and we ain’t got the time to be tired)

Alright, thanks for coming to my TedTalk.

Thanks,
Mgmt 

P.s. if anyone would like to join for any of the morning Masses, you are more than welcome to 🫶🏽

Road trip to Paul’s for GG’s nuggets first annual family ski  trip⛷️🎿 from February 21st-22nd/23rd!! @14159400947 @17037851134 @16037166863@17744201479 @13147437071 @19077177876@4915150998040 @19784712132 @16264612355 @19042103886 @15406227058 @15636632176 @12245189795 @18607366453
[2025-01-21T21:14:49.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: How much would all this cost 👀
[2025-01-21T21:18:24.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: 
[2025-01-21T21:23:33.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: V good question @16037166863 could you send that one link you sent about skiing? I almost wanna say it was free 🥹
[2025-01-21T21:24:12.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: https://skistorrshill.com/free-community-skiing
[2025-01-21T21:24:41.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: We would still need rentals which could cost anywhere from $50-100 imo
[2025-01-21T21:25:10.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: But for comparison, skiing at pat’s peak, for buying a ticket in advance, is $99
[2025-01-21T21:25:21.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: So the free skiing helps a ton 😅
[2025-01-21T21:59:47.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Paul you gotta drive by and scope it out 🤣
[2025-01-21T22:00:43.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: But ps they don’t do rentals so you’d have to find a ski shop. Apparently there’s a couple in Lebanon
[2025-01-21T22:04:34.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Okay, gratci @16037166863! Some of us are still in school and/or balling on a budget so, Storrs Hill looks to be our best option atm. But we would still need to rent gear? From the Storrs hill place, @17744201479 ?
[2025-01-21T22:04:35.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Lebanon...the country??
[2025-01-21T22:07:45.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: The wonderful city in New Hampshire 😂 Yes, you would need to rent gear. But that mountain is small and they don’t rent according to their website. So you’d have to find a local shop in town. In my experience in Vermont rentals can range from $40-80 a day when there’s lots of competition in the area
[2025-01-21T22:08:49.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Okay cool— good to know!! Thanks Adriano!
[2025-01-21T22:09:27.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: With this being said I don’t recall Lebanon being a ski town so might be more pricey. Let’s look for a store and confirm a price before going, I’d say.
[2025-01-21T22:10:01.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Paul is right, if you rent + day pass it’s insanely expensive. All the discounts nowadays are handed to people who go frequently and have season passes. The cost is passed down to the casual skier sadly.
[2025-01-21T22:10:43.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Killington day tickets are up 50% adjusted for inflation over the last decade for example, it’s discouraging
[2025-01-21T22:12:21.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Hmm, okay that’s understandable..what do you propose then? Maybe a different activity altogether in New Hampshire? I’m down for paintballing 👀
[2025-01-21T22:12:54.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I propose finding a ski shop that can get you guys hooked up with gear that’s all 😃
[2025-01-21T22:27:20.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I have asked some friends of mine who ski all the time if Storrs is a good mountain
[2025-01-21T22:27:23.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: So tbd on that
[2025-01-21T22:27:48.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Rentals could be done anywhere, theoretically, so long as we bring them back in time
[2025-01-21T22:29:09.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I mean pat’s peak with rentals on site would be $160, which is quite pricey, but also guaranteed quality and convenience
[2025-01-21T22:31:17.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: https://icecastles.com/new-hampshire/
[2025-01-21T22:32:31.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Really would highly recommend—ice castles are beautiful 🥹
[2025-01-21T23:14:40.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’m down for this one!
[2025-01-21T23:16:49.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Tickets are cheap too
[2025-01-22T00:25:54.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Okay, so while you guys are sorting out Skiing...im thinking about going country line dancing either Tuesday 01/28, 02/04 or 02/11 at Loretta's in Fenway. It's every Tue. and Sun.
[2025-01-22T00:27:02.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I could do Sunday but it has to be this upcoming Sunday because I (and Stacey) have rehearsals on Sundays after this month
[2025-01-22T00:27:39.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Anywayy, let me know if you want to join. No worries if you don't. I'll b going regardless! 🥳👢🐄🤠
[2025-01-22T00:44:48.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I am not opposed!
[2025-01-22T00:47:30.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I think I’m down! I gotta see how my studying goes this week but, count me in for now!
[2025-01-22T01:03:07.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’m also down for the ice castle! I would love to go line dancing, but I can’t do next week because I am cooking house dinner on Sunday, and it is Catholic Schools Week during the week, so I will need all of my energy to take on the week
[2025-01-22T01:03:42.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Also, anyone thinking about the St. Mary’s New Year’s Eve party or St. Paul’s 150th Anniversary on Saturday of this weekend?
[2025-01-22T01:03:52.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: 
[2025-01-22T01:04:49.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: 
[2025-01-22T01:07:12.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Oo I’ll definitely go to this one
[2025-01-22T01:07:26.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Maybe to the St Mary’s one
[2025-01-22T01:08:02.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: 100% in, any excuse to dress like a cowboy
[2025-01-22T01:09:06.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I didn’t hear about this Emily! Sounds like fun but I can’t make it this weekend 😩
[2025-01-22T01:19:06.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I miiiighhtt be available for this! I remember Fr.George mentioning this back in December!
[2025-01-23T17:41:08.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: If we go during off-peak, id b down
[2025-01-23T17:41:36.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Are you thinking about going to both? 👀
[2025-01-23T17:43:47.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’m so in!
[2025-01-23T17:44:25.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Trying to get caught up on the skiing deets but did we decide on killington? I have pass discounts if people are interested
[2025-01-23T17:48:05.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Please do share the details on pass discounts 👀 asking for the friends
[2025-01-23T17:51:14.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Yeah killington was not on the table iirc but it’s supposed to be the best skiing—if you have a good discount we definitely should go there
[2025-01-23T17:53:00.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I have 25% off for people or if we want to lock in now I think I can get 35% off
[2025-01-23T17:53:36.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: At killington or any ikon pass resort
[2025-01-23T17:58:22.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Also i think j could hook people up with cheap rentals $30 ish
[2025-01-23T18:00:00.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: As someone who’s been skiing for 24 years it’s so sad and absurd how expensive it’s gotten
[2025-01-23T18:03:10.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Well dang. Does Feb. 21-23 work for everyone?? _Please raise your hand_
[2025-01-23T18:20:13.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Do you have a limit on discounted tickets with Ikon @19077177876 ? That’s fine for me those dates, my yearly killington ski trip starts the 23 so I’ll be there anyways 😃
[2025-01-23T19:08:28.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Also @19077177876 when would you need to know to get 35% to lock in?
[2025-01-24T02:12:33.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I have 8 discounts left and would need to get the tickets before 14 Feb
[2025-01-24T02:14:05.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: With the discount it’s still $108 a day
[2025-01-24T02:20:37.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Are there no more than eight people interested?
[2025-01-24T02:20:50.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Just to skii? Or to skii and stay? Or just to stay?
[2025-01-24T02:21:21.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Also to be clear if we went 2/21-23, we would only ski Saturday realistically, right?
[2025-01-24T02:21:47.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I would suggest we probably would want to find a place to stay
[2025-01-24T02:22:04.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: So it would be $108, plus rental, plus lodging imo
[2025-01-24T02:22:08.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Do 10 people just to be safe. Also, for anyone worried about church sunday. Stacey and I will be heading back to Bos from NH either early Sunday or late Saturday so dont worry if that is a concern ( _ahem_ @19042103886 @15636632176 _ahem_)
[2025-01-24T02:22:37.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Well if Taylor has only eight discounts though—idk if we have that many people even interested
[2025-01-24T02:22:55.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I wont skii. I just want to be there!! So someone can take my spot worse comes to worse
[2025-01-24T02:22:56.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I know 8 people liked the message!
[2025-01-24T02:23:31.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Oh wait, im not in the 8 LOL
[2025-01-24T02:23:35.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: If push comes to shove—I have a job, I can pay full price if need be 🤑
[2025-01-24T02:24:34.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: 2/14 is an easy deadline for buying tickets with the discount, but for lodging we probably would want to move asap
[2025-01-24T02:25:04.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I don’t really know how to ski. Are there kid slopes or things for beginners I can use? Or do I need to take some lessons first?
[2025-01-24T02:25:25.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Also do they have tubing 👀
[2025-01-24T02:25:42.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Me and you both. We can make hot chocolate and play in the snow 🤪🤣
[2025-01-24T02:28:38.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Yeah just daily lift tickets are included in the discount
[2025-01-24T02:29:07.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: So we could have 4x skiers for 2 days or 8x skiers for 1 day
[2025-01-24T02:45:27.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I can join for skiing or frolicking, I am happy just to be around!
[2025-01-24T02:47:12.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: It has been awhile since I’ve been skiing anyways, so can’t say that I would have a ton of guts to get back on the slopes, so if there is a spare ticket, I’ll take it, but if not, consider me there for the vibes 😎
[2025-01-24T12:33:40.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: I parsed the chat as best I could. I’m happy to join the trip especially if it helps dilute the cost of lodging, but I don’t mind skiing or not skiing, so I can be with Celine. $50-100 for renting skis is approximately how much it’s worth it to me to ski.
[2025-01-24T12:39:08.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Yes, it works but I can sit out of the rental discount
[2025-01-24T13:03:30.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Choose your adventure
[2025-01-24T13:06:00.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: ^ everyone complete the poll please so we can get a clear count of who wants to ski vs chill :)
[2025-01-24T17:15:24.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: 
[2025-01-24T13:33:21.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: also @16037166863 Im still down to go to the ice castles thing, even with just a small group of peeps! It seems like so much funnn 🥹. Is it better to go at night?
[2025-01-24T14:14:56.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I think it is good any time 😇
[2025-01-24T14:15:22.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: It’s a great day trip i.e. we go up like Saturday morning and return in evening
[2025-01-24T16:38:17.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Assuming @14159400947 wants to ski too

[2025-01-24T18:54:08.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Definitely looks less like a horror movie!! It’s cutee
[2025-01-24T18:54:14.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: It’ll be 130$ a person!

[2025-01-24T18:56:06.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Might need to share beds or bring your own air mattress if you don't want to share.  All in favor, _please raise your hand_

> "This one above is my favvv^ It’s only an hour away from killington and only two hours away from Boston" - Ariele, our agent
[2025-01-24T18:56:22.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: We can share Celine 🤝
[2025-01-24T18:56:48.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: There’s enough beds for everyone tho if the boys don’t mind cuddling in a queen
[2025-01-24T18:59:28.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Also I’m officially in the baby slope ski group 🤝 (aka Ariele, Stacey, and I)

[2025-01-24T19:16:13.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: And besides how would you all get the discount?
[2025-01-24T19:16:24.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: BAHAHAHAHA ur the main guy!!!
[2025-01-24T19:16:57.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: The chalet houses 16 people so we are good!
[2025-01-24T19:16:58.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I MEANT I DIDNT KNOW IF I WERE ALSO USING THE DISCOUNT
[2025-01-24T19:17:07.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: AS IN IF THE 8 INCLUDED YOU 😂😂🤣🤣😭😭😭
[2025-01-24T19:17:34.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Oh nah I have a pass so it’s theoretically free technically like 80 bucks for me
[2025-01-24T19:17:47.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’m way too bought into the ski industry
[2025-01-24T19:18:14.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: If there’s not enough beds I can crash on a couch or something
[2025-01-24T19:18:55.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: bois?? 👀
[2025-01-24T19:19:18.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: There’s def enough beds
[2025-01-24T20:53:32.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: So we should probably reserve soon
[2025-01-24T22:56:05.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Soooo couple questions:
1) are we committed to two nights? To save money we could all drive up Saturday morning, ski stay the night into Sunday and drive back Sunday night. Or shift that plan left a day if people want to make church on Sunday (I won’t make Friday)
2) do we want to spend the night an hour away from the resort when killington is 2.5 hrs from Boston? 
3) if we go for the 2-day/one night option we can get a place closer to killington and save $$$
[2025-01-24T23:00:10.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I found this place for 1369 for one night that’s 20-30 mins from killington
[2025-01-24T23:02:12.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: There’s also a similarly priced place in Rutland a 20 min drive away
[2025-01-24T23:03:29.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I am in support of just one night + I know Elizabeth said she'd prefer one night oo
[2025-01-24T23:03:58.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: too*
[2025-01-24T23:05:49.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Also one night pls 🙋🏽‍♀️ Celine and I would be leaving either Saturday night or early Sunday to make it for the morning Masses
[2025-01-24T23:08:47.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Friday night into sat then?
[2025-01-24T23:19:19.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’m down
[2025-01-25T00:01:09.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Is anyone going to play without ceasing 👀
[2025-01-25T00:13:22.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I am not 😭 sry :(
[2025-01-25T17:40:56.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: If we do one night are we still doing Arielle’s place?
[2025-01-25T17:41:30.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Let me check the price if we do one night!
[2025-01-25T17:54:56.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Gosh, I made it through the group chat😮‍💨 We need summaries every now and then, so people can skip the rest… I am interested in skiing and prefer two days/ one night. Don’t care if Friday to Saturday or Saturday to Sunday but definitely need a Sunday mass (Catholic obligation and stuff besides I actually want to go). Wow, feels great to finally participate in this group chat😂
[2025-01-25T18:11:57.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: We can also go to mass together up in the mountains, we don’t have to be back in Boston for that. Just throwing that out there
[2025-01-25T18:12:20.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Mountain mass sounds sick

[2025-01-25T18:31:04.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: About tonight, I think that I am going to start at St. Paul’s around 6:30PM then head over to St. Mary’s from there because they are having Just Dance and yo gurl has to dance!
[2025-01-25T18:33:22.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: And a side tangent: anyone else a fan of Knox? He has a new album coming out that I am hyped for, and he will be performing in Boston the night of Palm Sunday (April 13th) if anyone is down to go! 🎸🎤
[2025-01-25T18:35:45.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: But yeah, I think I might be team head back to Boston for Mass with Celine and Stacey, but the temptation to explore new churches is always there 🤩
[2025-01-25T19:43:13.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Emily girl! I decided to come tonight to St.Pauls so, I’ll see you there🫶🏽!
[2025-01-25T19:43:47.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’m thinking too… what about the rest?
[2025-01-25T20:11:08.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’m also going to the St. Paul’s thing! :)
[2025-01-25T20:11:18.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Just dance lowkey sounds fun 👀
[2025-01-25T20:12:24.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’ll see how I feel after the St. Paul’s thing though
[2025-01-25T20:12:46.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Elizabeth & I are still in DC so won’t make it 💔
[2025-01-25T20:12:54.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Is the thing at St Paul’s a wine and cheese thing?
[2025-01-25T20:15:48.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: It is exactly that
[2025-01-25T20:16:00.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Yep!
[2025-01-25T20:16:06.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: And balloon animals lol

[2025-01-25T20:33:34.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Actually not sure if it’s for students too 🙈
[2025-01-25T20:38:37.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I think that Father George said that it is open to all young adults, grad students, and young professionals when I saw him last
[2025-01-25T22:34:27.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Re: skiing we should lock in a place this weekend cause there aren’t many options left
[2025-01-25T22:38:28.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I think we have to agree because someone will front the money that we will pay, even if something comes up and plans change etc
[2025-01-25T22:42:35.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I prefer 3 days, 2 nights so that we hav more time together, even if Stacey, Emily and I cant stay for the entirety of Sunday and have mass in the mountains
[2025-01-25T22:42:58.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: However, I'm cool with whatever the majority is most comfortable with so let me make a poll and let's settle it asap
[2025-01-25T22:43:50.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Duration of Trip
[2025-01-25T22:43:54.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: As much as I’d love to do 2 nights I’m probably just going to do 1 night 2 days but happy to throw in a pro-rate for the 2nd day to balance things out
[2025-01-25T22:44:11.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: If WhatsApp has an api we can definitely make a bot that will take the feed of texts, feed into ChatGPT, then posts a message in the WhatsApp that summarizes the state of affairs
[2025-01-25T22:44:24.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Similar to what discord or Reddit and other platforms have these days
[2025-01-25T22:44:45.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us:

[2025-01-25T22:45:19.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Better yet ask ChatGPT to just write all code. lol

[2025-01-26T03:47:38.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Haha you guys should go to “passion city church”. It’s like the popping young people church where it’s like a music concert, pastor is awesome, and it’s pretty flirty. You also won’t see a person over 40 basically 🧏🏼‍♀️. So Elizabeth will enjoy
[2025-01-26T03:48:38.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: It’s where my good friends from back home go
[2025-01-26T03:48:44.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Non denominational

[2025-01-26T05:09:38.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Good things I hope Shiela
[2025-01-26T05:10:18.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Hahaha I was sharing with her a dream I had. And you saved me through dance
[2025-01-26T05:10:24.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: It was hilarious hahaha
[2025-01-26T05:10:58.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: And then we were both like “man we love Adriano. He’s such a good friend”
[2025-01-26T05:15:01.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Celine is trying to lobby me to get me to change my vote 😡

[2025-01-26T14:48:41.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Oh man you should have opened a new credit card and gotten the sign up bonus that’s some money rt there

[2025-01-26T14:49:43.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Chase sapphire preferred CC. You get $600 if you spend $4k first 3 months
[2025-01-26T14:49:51.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Bahahahaha
[2025-01-26T14:50:02.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: I went down the rabbit hole recently
[2025-01-26T14:50:03.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: should I book one night?
[2025-01-26T14:50:49.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: I’m thinking of some final way to lock in everyone’s decision before you pull trigger
[2025-01-26T14:52:04.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: The question is if someone from the two nighter wants to now pullout given it’s only one night but that’s not me
[2025-01-26T14:52:22.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Vice a versa…😒
[2025-01-26T14:52:58.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Whatever is decided I’ll stand behind (paying for my portion and being in)
[2025-01-26T14:53:33.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: If 8 people want to do two nights they pay the 2 night prices and 1 nighters pay the one night
[2025-01-26T14:54:15.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I say we send it we have everyone’s preferences
[2025-01-26T14:54:24.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Re:
[2025-01-26T14:57:50.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Good idea!!
[2025-01-26T14:58:16.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Hmmm if we do the one night what time would we be getting back on Saturday?
[2025-01-26T14:58:32.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Like people won’t be too tired to drive after skiing right?
[2025-01-26T14:59:28.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I think if you can stay the two nights, def stay the two nights. If you’re seriously tight on cash or have a commitment like Celine and Stacey then stay one night!
[2025-01-26T15:00:05.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Anyone have a Costco membership?
[2025-01-26T15:00:13.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Celine and Stacey want two night
[2025-01-26T15:00:21.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: But will leave Sunday morning
[2025-01-26T15:00:22.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: YAY
[2025-01-26T15:00:45.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: okay I’m gonna book the two nights, if you’re really strapped for cash or can’t stay both nights let me know and I’m gonna do a slight price adjustment!!
[2025-01-26T15:02:15.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: 
[2025-01-26T15:11:02.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Stacey and Celine and Emily are commiting to 2 nights
[2025-01-26T15:11:15.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: If everyone could Venmo me 113$ I will book the chalet today! 

@13147437071 @12245189795 @4915150998040 @15406227058you guys can send me 70$
[2025-01-26T15:11:33.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: https://venmo.com/u/Ariele-Lee
[2025-01-26T15:12:05.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Yes ok that’s a decent compromise. So long as there’s no exodus of people who decide to stay 1 night it will keep down the cost per night for everyone
[2025-01-26T15:13:03.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: (Goes without saying the more people who flip to one night, the more it drives up the cost per night per person)
[2025-01-26T15:14:03.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: When do we need to commit to skiing @19077177876 👀

[2025-01-26T15:21:44.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: @19077177876 🙏 U a real one 🥺🥹
[2025-01-26T15:25:05.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Drop your emails here and I’ll send you a referral link
[2025-01-26T15:25:52.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: aren't only 8 people able to ski with the discount?
[2025-01-26T15:27:21.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: In igbo, my mom says “ebe i si weputa, Chineke kwuachi’ng mmaji kwuru mmaji” which basically translates to “where you’ve taken out, may God repay you ten times over” ..the “mmaji kwuru mmaji” doesn’t actually mean “ten times over” but that’s basically what it’s trying to say

All that to say, thank you Taylor🥹 and God bless you🙏🏽♥️
[2025-01-26T15:27:45.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: nibe418@gmail.com
[2025-01-26T15:39:54.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: lol not to keep asking a bunch of questions but also what is the estimated cost for skiing for both the day pass and rentals again?
[2025-01-26T15:53:32.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Thank you for offering @19077177876. Can offer you for my Costco membership in return 😃 my email is adrianojsoares1@gmail.com
[2025-01-26T15:54:06.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Taylor can tell you the cost of the buddy pass, but rentals are probably about $40at the ski shops in town.
[2025-01-26T15:54:12.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: We should do a Costco run for food
[2025-01-26T15:54:14.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: And snacks
[2025-01-26T15:55:11.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Yeah standby
[2025-01-26T15:55:26.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: And seriously it’s nbd guys!! Just love skiing with people
[2025-01-26T16:00:01.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Lmk what the price is when you get the code (sending now) but Saturday the 22d with the 35% off is $116
[2025-01-26T16:05:58.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Adriano had a great idea: for us who aren’t quite the shredders who want to tear up the full killington mountain there’s a sister resort down the road called Pico for $99/day
[2025-01-26T16:06:27.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: It wouldn’t be that hard to spilt the group and then meet up for apres at the end of the day at killington
[2025-01-26T16:06:36.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: For ref:
[2025-01-26T16:07:25.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Yes, it’s a sister resort that belongs to Killington. There’s a 3 mile trail that connects them (lol) but also a bus IIRC. So it would be easy to meet up later.
[2025-01-26T16:16:00.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’ll do this
[2025-01-26T16:16:14.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Paid btw @19784712132

[2025-01-26T16:59:52.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: 
[2025-01-26T17:08:20.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I think they are are only supposed to be paying around fifty for the one night
[2025-01-26T17:08:34.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: It’s 70!
[2025-01-26T17:15:08.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Pico mountain is $80/pp with @19077177876’s discount. Rentals are $40 a day including boots helmet skis & poles in town. All in, $120/day to ski
[2025-01-26T17:15:29.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Done 😎

[2025-01-26T17:15:39.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: That is the lesser mountain right?
[2025-01-26T17:16:09.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Are we buying individually or venmoing someone?
[2025-01-26T17:17:17.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Taylor has to send you the code. Then you have to buy yourself.

[2025-01-26T17:30:58.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: also can we just show up or do we have to reserve rentals early too?
[2025-01-26T17:39:10.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Math people can you confirm this breakdown
[2025-01-26T17:39:33.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Yeah Sheila might have a more accurate breakdown of the prices owed cuz I’m terrible at math
[2025-01-26T17:39:51.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: No but I’m terrible too haha #humanitiesmajor

[2025-01-27T00:28:26.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: Make a Google sheet is probably the best idea
[2025-01-27T00:28:45.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: I’ll check out your math, give you a grade
[2025-01-27T00:51:17.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Thank you for your service mr mit
[2025-01-27T01:47:15.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I didn’t read the whole thing in here but I can also pay two nights because then I won’t leave earlier on my own… how much would it be then?
[2025-01-27T01:47:37.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: 113$!
[2025-01-27T02:40:21.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: @19042103886 this is how I mathed it https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DRZdbfMKGfr64Ewp8Hgspz_MrTFb2SU-aYVK57Jh27I/edit?gid=0#gid=0
[2025-01-27T02:41:09.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: shared
[2025-01-27T02:41:32.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: 113$ sounds about right
[2025-01-27T02:46:27.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Now I’m confused haha okay so peeps for one night pay (53.85) and peeps who want to stay for two nights pay ($107)?
[2025-01-27T02:47:18.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Ooooo i didn’t have Audrey in the total
[2025-01-27T02:47:38.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Audrey isn’t able to come :(
[2025-01-27T02:48:26.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: How many people total are going
[2025-01-27T02:48:30.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I calculated 13
[2025-01-27T02:48:57.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: But I think it’s 14
[2025-01-27T02:52:09.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Also Ian mentioned he can stay two nights!
[2025-01-27T02:52:10.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: im looking at the votes
[2025-01-27T02:53:54.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: looking at the votes..and updating the spreadsheet give me a min
[2025-01-27T02:57:17.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: I haven't read the chat but if $1400 is the cost of the housing then the current state of the spreadsheet reflects the cost per person for housing alone. I am not including any kind of tangential activity costs
[2025-01-27T02:57:31.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: Gas, food
[2025-01-27T02:57:34.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: looks like $122 for two nighters and 60.87 for 1 nighters
[2025-01-27T02:58:09.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: If Ian is two nights though don’t all our costs go down?
[2025-01-27T02:58:17.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: (For 2 nighters)
[2025-01-27T02:58:25.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: gas / food should probably be computed  separately to reduce confusion
[2025-01-27T02:58:30.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I wish we could have a PowerPoint night on this
[2025-01-27T02:58:33.000Z] 120363361936818817@g.us: I’m down for 2 nights if it helps
[2025-01-27T02:58:36.000Z] 17037851134@c.us: yes, I am including IAn at 2 nights
